Unlike other solutions that rely on intelligence or signatures, our solution can detect and block zero-day malware and the most advanced persistent threats to date. Out of the box would have detected and prevented hacks such as ones to the DNC,OPM,Sony, and others. Metapacket automatically blocks malware and exploitation attempts including from unknown or zero-day threats and generates highly-focused and clear incident reports.<\/p>",
